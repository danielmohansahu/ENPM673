# large outstanding issues:
 - current AR detection doesn't determine tag orientation
    - proposed soln: align detected contour before returning (based on shape matching)
 - current AR detection only gets tags from 1 video (those without inner black squares)
    - proposed soln: don't just check smallest contour; check all of them for candidates
 - current warp_image function is way too slow
 - current warp_image function has messy / lost data
 

 - no tracking (part 2b) implemented yet
